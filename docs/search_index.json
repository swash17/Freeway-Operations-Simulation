Washburn Civil and Coastal Engineering University of Florida https://swash.essie.ufl.edu 2023-01-17 Chapter 1 Introduction Course Description: This course addresses the area of freeway operations analysis and simulation. Topics covered include: Uninterrupted flow fundamentals HCM freeway analysis methodologies Basic segments Merge/diverge segments Weaving segments Facility (undersaturated and oversaturated) Travel time reliability Managed Lanes Ramp Metering Simulation Background and Course Objectives: Freeway facilities are intended to offer the highest level of mobility of any component within the roadway network. Freeways are also generally responsible for moving the largest volume of traffic in the network. Given the vital purpose that these roadway facilities serve, it is essential for the traffic engineer to be able to properly analyze these facilities, under a variety of traffic demand, geometric, and management/control configurations. Freeway facilities are typically distinguished from other roadway types by the following features: Access controlled on-/off-ramps 2 or more lanes per direction Divided opposing directions separated by barrier or median ‘High’ design (designed to accommodate higher speeds) paved shoulders, greater shoulder width greater lane width minimize grades, especially in urban areas minimize horizontal curvature, especially in urban areas In urban areas, freeway facilities will often also include features such as high-occupancy vehicle lanes, high-occupancy toll lanes, and/or ramp metering. This course has five primary learning objectives. In this course, the student is expected to… learn the fundamental principles underlying traffic flow on freeway facilities learn how to analyze the operational impacts of freeway traffic flow with the analytical methods of the Highway Capacity Manual (HCM) learn how to apply a simulation tool to the analysis of freeway operations develop an understanding of the limitations of both the HCM analysis methods and of microsimulation develop an understanding of the differences in results generated by the HCM analysis methods and simulation for situations in which both can be applied for the analysis.

Because each driver behaves in a unique way (i.e., has its own brain), it is not possible to describe traffic flow as theoretically concisely as other purely physical phenomena. This makes the field of traffic engineering especially challenging. Nonetheless, we still need ways to quantify traffic streams, so we can analyze and evaluate existing transportation facilities, and design improvements for those facilities. There are several parameters that we will now discuss that are used to quantitatively describe traffic streams. 2.1.2 Flow Classification Two general types of flow environments: Uninterrupted flow – traffic flow influenced by characteristics of roadway and interactions of vehicles within the traffic stream Interrupted Flow – traffic streams also operate under the influence of traffic control devices 2.1.3 Parameter Classification Traffic stream parameters are generally classified in two categories: Microscopic - refer to characteristics specific to individual pairs of vehicles within the traffic stream Macroscopic - refer to characteristics of the traffic stream as a whole. Represents an aggregation of the microscopic measures. 2.1.4 Microscopic Parameters Two commonly used microscopic parameters are: Spacing – the physical distance between successive vehicles Headway – the time between successive vehicles as they pass a point on a lane or roadway Note that measurements should reference the same point on each vehicle (e.g., front bumper) The three main macroscopic parameters that form the underpinning of traffic analysis are: Flow, q Speed, u Density, k 2.1.5 Flow Traffic flow is defined as \\[q = \\frac{n}{t} \\tag{Textbook Eq. 5.1}\\] where: q = traffic flow in vehicles per unit time, n = number of vehicles passing some designated roadway point during time t, and t = duration of time interval. The time between the passage of successive vehicles, at some designated highway point, is known as the time headway. These time headways are related to t, as defined in Eq. 5.1, by \\[t = \\sum_{i\\ = \\ 1}^{n}h_{i}\\tag{Textbook Eq. 5.2}\\] where: t = duration of time interval, hi = time headway of the ith vehicle (the time that has transpired between the arrival of vehicle i and i -1), and n = number of measured vehicle time headways at some designated roadway point. Substituting Eq. 5.2 into Eq. 5.1 gives \\[q = \\frac{n}{\\sum_{i\\ = \\ 1}^{n}h_{i}}\\tag{Textbook Eq. 5.3}\\] or \\[q = \\frac{1}{\\overline{h}}\\tag{Textbook Eq. 5.4}\\] where: \\[\\overline{h} \\text { is the average time headway,}\\] \\[\\frac{\\sum h_{i}}{n} \\text { in unit time per vehicle.}\\] Typical volume measures: Daily Time Unit Average Annual Daily Traffic (AADT) Total daily volume passing point on roadway in both directions Total yearly traffic volume divided by number of days in year Average Annual Weekday Traffic (AAWT) Hourly Time Unit Peak Hour Volume Sometimes design peak hour volumes are estimated from daily volume projections, using three parameters: AADT K – proportion of daily traffic occurring during the peak hour D – proportion of peak-hour traffic traveling in the peak direction Typical range of K and D values: K: 0.08 – 0.12 D: 0.52 – 0.62 (1.0 for one-way roadway) Directional Design Hour Volume (DDHV) \\[DDHV = AADT \\times K \\times D \\tag{Textbook Eq. 6.25}\\] Peak Hour Factor (PHF) - typically used in traffic analysis methods of HCM \\[PHF = \\frac{V}{V_{15} \\times 4} \\tag{Textbook Eq. 6.8}\\] V = hourly volume for hour of analysis, V15 = maximum 15-min volume within hour of analysis, and 4 = number of 15-min periods per hour. 2.1.6 Speed Average traffic speed is defined in two ways: Time (spot) mean speed is the average speed of all vehicles passing a point on a roadway over a specified time (instantaneous point speed, as taken by a radar gun for example). \\[{\\bar{u}}_{t}\\text{ = }\\frac{\\sum_{i\\ = \\ 1}^{n}u_{i}}{n}\\tag{Textbook Eq 5.5}\\] where: \\({\\bar{u}}_{t}\\) = time-mean speed in unit distance per unit time, ui = spot speed (the speed of the vehicle at the designated point on the highway, as might be obtained using a radar gun) of the ith vehicle, and n = number of measured vehicle spot speeds. Space mean speed is the average speed of all vehicles occupying a given section of roadway over a specified time (essentially, the inverse of travel time for all vehicles over the specified section length). This second definition of speed is more useful in the context of traffic analysis and is determined on the basis of the time necessary for a vehicle to travel some known length of roadway. \\[{\\bar{u}}_{s} = \\frac{l}{\\bar{t}}\\tag{Textbook Eq. 5.6}\\] where: \\({\\bar{u}}_{s}\\) = space-mean speed in unit distance per unit time, l = length of roadway used for travel time measurement of vehicles, \\({\\bar{t}}\\)= average vehicle travel time, defined as \\[\\bar{t} = \\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{i = 1}^{n}t_{i}\\tag{Textbook Eq. 5.7}\\] where: ti = time necessary for vehicle i to travel roadway section of length l, and n = number of measured vehicle travel times. Substituting Eq. 5.7 into Eq. 5.6 gives \\[{\\bar{u}}_{s} = \\frac{l}{\\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{i = 1}^{n}t_{i}}\\tag{Textbook Eq. 5.8}\\] or \\[{\\bar{u}}_{s} = \\frac{1}{\\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{i = 1}^{n}\\left\\lbrack \\frac{1}{\\left( \\frac{l}{t_{i}} \\right)} \\right\\rbrack}\\tag{Textbook Eq. 5.9}\\] which is the harmonic mean of speed (space-mean speed). Space-mean speed is the speed parameter used in traffic models. Typical Speed Measures Average - arithmetic mean (TMS) or harmonic mean (SMS) 85th Percentile - speed at which 85% of the vehicles are traveling at or below Running - does not include stopped delay 2.1.7 Density Traffic density is defined as \\[k = \\frac{n}{l}\\tag{Textbook Eq. 5.10}\\] where: k = traffic density in vehicles per unit distance, n = number of vehicles occupying some length of roadway at some specified time, and l = length of roadway. The density can also be related to the individual spacing between successive vehicles. The roadway length, l, in Eq. 5.10 can be defined as \\[l\\ = \\sum_{i\\ = \\ 1}^{n}s_{i}\\tag{Textbook Eq. 5.11}\\] where: si = spacing of the ith vehicle (the distance between vehicle i and i-1, measured from same vehicle reference point), and n = number of measured vehicle spacings. Substituting Eq. 5.11 into Eq. 5.10 gives \\[k\\ = \\frac{n}{\\sum_{i\\ = \\ 1}^{n}s_{i}}\\tag{Textbook Eq. 5.12}\\] \\[k\\ = \\frac{1}{\\bar{s}}\\tag{Textbook Eq. 5.13}\\] where: \\[\\overline{s} \\text { is the average vehicle spacing,}\\] \\[\\frac{\\sum s_{i}}{n} \\text { in unit distance per vehicle.}\\] 2.1.8 Variable Relationships Based on the definitions presented above, a simple identity provides the basic relationship among traffic flow, speed (space-mean speed), and density (denoting space-mean speed, \\({\\bar{u}}_{s}\\), as simply u for notational convenience), \\[q = u \\times k\\tag{Textbook Eq. 5.14}\\] where: q = flow, typically in units of vehicles per hour (veh/h), u = speed (space mean speed), typically in units of mi/h, and k = density, typically in units of veh/mi. 2.1.9 Basic Traffic Stream Models: Speed vs. Density \\[u = u_{f}\\left(1 - \\frac{k}{k_{j}} \\right)\\tag{Textbook Eq. 5.15}\\] where: u = space-mean speed in mi/h, uf = free-flow speed in mi/h, k = density in veh/mi, and kj = jam density in veh/mi.

To demonstrate this, let the average arrival rate, λ, be in units of vehicles per second, so that \\[\\lambda\\ = \\frac{q}{3600}\\frac{\\text{veh/h}}{\\text {s/h}}=\\frac{\\text{veh}}{\\text{s}}\\tag{Textbook Eq. 5.24}\\] Substituting into the Poisson equation yields \\[P\\left( n \\right)\\ = \\frac{\\left( \\frac{{qt}}{3600} \\right)^{n} \\times e^{- \\frac{{qt}}{3600}}}{n!}\\tag{Textbook Eq. 5.25}\\] Note that the probability of having no vehicles arrive in a time interval of length t (P(0)) is the equivalent of the probability of a vehicle headway, h, being greater than or equal to the time interval t. So from the previous equation, \\[P\\left(0 \\right)\\ = P\\left( h \\geq t \\right)\\tag{Textbook Eq. 5.26}\\] \\[\\frac{(1)e^{\\frac{-qt}{3600}}}{1} = e^{\\frac{-qt}{3600}}\\] Note: x0 = 1, 0! = 1 This distribution of vehicle headways is known as the negative exponential distribution. 2.3 Freeway Queuing 2.3.1 Introduction The purpose of traffic queuing models is to provide a means to estimate important measures of freeway performance, including vehicle delay and traffic queue lengths. Such estimates are critical to roadway design (the required length of left-turn bays and the number of lanes at intersections) and traffic operations control, including the timing of traffic signals at intersections. Queuing models are often identified by three alphanumeric values. The first value indicates the arrival rate assumption, the second value gives the departure rate assumption, and the third value indicates the number of departure channels. For traffic arrival and departure assumptions, the uniform, deterministic distribution is denoted D and the stochastic, exponential distribution is denoted M. Thus a D/D/1 queuing model assumes deterministic arrivals and departures with one departure channel. Similarly, an M/D/1 queuing model assumes exponentially distributed arrival times, deterministic departure times, and one departure channel. The case of deterministic arrivals and departures with one departure channel (D/D/1 queue) is an excellent starting point in understanding queuing models because of its simplicity. The D/D/1 queue lends itself to an intuitive graphical or mathematical solution, which will be illustrated by an in-class example. 2.3.2 Traffic Analysis at Freeway Bottlenecks Some of the most severe congestion problems occur at freeway bottlenecks, which are defined as a portion of freeway with a lower capacity (qcap) than the incoming section of freeway. This reduction in capacity can originate from a number of sources, including a decrease in the number of freeway lanes and reduced shoulder widths (which tend to cause drivers to slow and thus effectively reduce freeway capacity). There are two general types of traffic bottlenecks—those that are recurring and those that are incident induced. Recurring bottlenecks exist where the freeway itself limits capacity—for example, by a physical reduction in the number of lanes. Traffic congestion at such bottlenecks results from recurring traffic flows that exceed the vehicle capacity of the freeway in the bottleneck area. In contrast, incident-induced bottlenecks occur as a result of vehicle breakdowns or accidents that effectively reduce freeway capacity by restricting the through movement of traffic. Because incident-induced bottlenecks are unanticipated and temporary in nature, they have features that distinguish them from recurring bottlenecks, such as the possibility that the capacity resulting from an incident-induced bottleneck may change over time. For example, an accident may initially stop traffic flow completely, but as the wreckage is cleared, partial capacity (one lane open) may be provided for a period of time before full capacity is eventually restored. A feature shared by recurring and incident-induced bottlenecks is the adjustment in traffic flow that may occur as travelers choose other routes and/or different trip departure times, to avoid the bottleneck area, in response to visual information or traffic advisories. The most intuitive approach to analyzing traffic congestion at bottlenecks is to assume D/D/1 queuing, which will be illustrated by an in-class example.

The Highway Capacity Manual (HCM) serves as a fundamental reference on concepts, performance measures, and analysis techniques for evaluating the multimodal operation of streets, highways, freeways, and off-street pathways. The text in the following three sections is largely excerpted from Chapter 1 of the HCM (p. 1-4) 3.2 Purpose and Objectives The purpose of the HCM is to provide methodologies and associated application procedures for evaluating the multimodal performance of highway and street facilities in terms of operational measures and one or more quality-of-service indicators. The objectives of the HCM are to: 1. Define performance measures and describe survey methods for key traffic characteristics, 2. Provide methodologies for estimating and predicting performance measures, and 3. Explain methodologies at a level of detail that allows readers to understand the factors affecting multimodal operation. The HCM presents the best available techniques at the time of publishing for determining capacity and level of service (LOS). However, it does not establish a legal standard for highway design or construction. 3.3 Intended Use The HCM is intended to be used primarily for the analysis areas listed below, to the extent that they are supported by the individual analysis methodologies. Levels of analysis: operations, design, preliminary engineering, and planning. Travel modes: motorized vehicles, pedestrian, and bicycle, plus transit when it is part of a multimodal urban street facility. Spatial coverage: points, segments, and facilities. Temporal coverage: undersaturated and oversaturated conditions. 3.4 Target Users The HCM is prepared for use by (a) engineers who work in the field of traffic operations or highway geometric design and (b) transportation planners who work in the field of transportation system management. To use the manual effectively and to apply its methodologies, some technical background is desirable—typically university-level training or technical work in a public agency or consulting firm. The HCM is also useful to management personnel, educators, air quality specialists, noise specialists, elected officials, regional land use planners, and interest groups representing special users. 3.5 Versions of the HCM The first HCM was published in 1950. Since that time, new editions of the HCM have been published every 10-20 years. Previous HCM editions have had a year in the title, although they have also been referred to with an “edition” number. The previous HCM editions are listed below. Figure 3.1: 1950 HCM: Only 160 pages long, and focused on capacity related to the U.S. roadway network expansion after World War II. 1965: Introduction of the level of service (LOS) concept and bus transit chapter. Figure 3.2: 1965 HCM: Introduction of the level of service (LOS) concept and bus transit chapter. Starting with the 1985 edition, results of new research on highway capacity and quality of service were presented for measuring roadway performance. Figure 3.3: 1985 HCM: Significant research incorporated adding pedestrians and bicycles chapters. Updates to this edition were made in 1992, 1994, and 1997. Figure 3.4: 2000 HCM: Added new research with increase in volume and breadth. In order to make the material in the HCM 2000 easier to understand and follow, the HCM 2010 was reorganized with new material added from research projects. A broader range of performance measures were introduced for assessing the performance of transportation facilities and all roadway users. Figure 3.5: 2010 HCM: New research added, additional focus on non-automobile modes, four volumes. It was reorganized to make it more clear and understandable.

Figure 3.7: The current version, The Highway Capacity Manual, 7th Edition: A Guide for Multimodal Mobility Analysis. 3.6 Who Oversees Development and Maintenance of the HCM? The Transportation Research Board’s Highway Capacity and Quality of Service Committee (HCQSC) is responsible for development and maintenance of the HCM. The HCQSC is comprised of the following subcommittees: interrupted flow, uninterrupted flow, cross-cutting issues, applications, and technology transfer. Membership Typically 30-32 Full committee members Generally a member can serve a maximum of 3 consecutive 3-year terms Organizations represented Public Agency Private Consulting Academia Broad geographic diversity Subcommittee membership No official limit, controlled by subcommittee chairs Meetings TRB Annual Meeting Typical meeting schedule: Saturday 1:00 pm – 6:00 pm Sunday 8:00 am – 6:00 pm Monday 8:00 am - 12:00 PM Mid-year Meeting Typically held in June or July Rotates locations Occasionally held in an international location Last 3: Berlin (2016), Stockholm (2011), Tokyo (2006) My involvement with committee… Actively involved with the HCQS committee since 2000 Full committee member, 2006-2016 Freeways/Multilane Highways subcommittee chair, 2006-2011 User Liaison subcommittee chair, 2011-2016 Focus of my involvement with the committee has primarily been with the uninterrupted-flow analysis methodologies and content 3.7 Scope and Structure of the HCM The HCM addresses four dimensions for providing transportation mobility for people and goods: Quantity of travel, the magnitude of use of a transportation facility or service; Quality of travel, users’ perceptions of travel on a transportation facility or service with respect to their expectations; Accessibility, the ease with which travelers can engage in desired activities; and Capacity, the ability of a transportation facility or service to meet the quantity of travel demanded of it. The HCM is divided into four volumes: three printed and one online. Volume 1 houses concepts material, Volume 2 describes the methodologies for freeways and highways, Volume 3 describes the methodologies for urban streets and off-street pedestrian and bicycle facilities, and Volume 4 provides additional resources that support the material in the printed HCM. General highway capacity and quality of service concepts were addressed in Volume 1. The typical Volumes 2 and 3 section layout consists of: Detailed chapter-specific concepts, such as service volume tables, have been added. Methodological chapters begin with a short introduction describing the purpose of the chapter, the information found within it, and cross-references to related material in other chapters. The core motorized vehicle methodology (e.g., two-lane highway analysis for motor vehicles) is presented next, including the method’s strengths and limitations, circumstances when alternative tools might be considered, the method’s required input data (and potential sources), and a description of the flow of calculations. Mode-specific methodologies (e.g., bicycle travel on two-lane highways), to better highlight the existence of these methods, are provided after the motorized vehicle methodology An applications section provides information about applying the chapter’s method to planning and preliminary engineering, operations, and design analyses; often provides example results; and discusses the use of the method in conjunction with alternative tools, when available. A reference section for each chapter is provided. 3.7.1 Volume 1 - Concepts Volume 1 introduces concepts that all HCM users should be familiar with before applying the manual. The chapter structure of Volume 1 is the same as the HCM 2010. Chapter 36 in online Volume 4 provides supplemental information that supports Volume 1; new information in this chapter includes guidance on measuring travel time reliability in the field and listings of reliability values for selected U.S. facilities.

Figure 3.8: HCM 7th Edition, Volume 4: Applications Guide Source: Transportation Research Board Volume 4 provides more than just access to supplemental chapters. The HCQSC periodically issues interpretations and errata for the HCM that result from user questions and feedback. These errata are posted in Volume 4. The technical reference library provides access to many of the source research reports that form the basis for the HCM analysis methods, including: The HCM Applications Guidebook: This is an online tool that demonstrates how the HCM can be applied to a project as it evolves from concept to design to implementation. The Planning and Preliminary Engineering Applications Guide: This demonstrates how HCM concepts and methods can be incorporated into planning-level evaluations. Discussion Forum: This allows HCM users to ask questions of the broader HCM community on proper application of the HCM methodologies, technical interpretations, provide feedback about the HCM, etc. Committee members monitor and respond to the forum. 3.8 Recent Updates (6th and 7th editions) New title, to reflect how HCM content has expanded considerably beyond simply “highway capacity” Multimodal analysis (autos, trucks, peds, bikes, buses) Added travel time reliability, active transportation and demand management (ATDM), managed lanes, work zones, and alternative intersection operations. Capacity measurement: Many default values for capacity, and methods for estimating capacity, have been included in the HCM over the years. However, little guidance was provided for methods/techniques for measuring capacity from the field. Some improvement in this area was made for the HCM 6th edition, but this will continue to be a major focus for the committee, so that transportation agencies can determine capacity values most appropriate for their region. Impacts on capacity and operations as a function of advances in connected and autonomous vehicles. For example, see SunCam course 208-Future Highways – Automated Vehicles (https://www.suncam.com/courses/100250-01.html.) Two-lane highway analysis: The new two-lane highway analysis methodology, developed from NCHRP Project 17-65 (https://www.nap.edu/catalog/25179/improved-analysis-of-two-lane-highway-capacity-and-operational-performance). 3.9 Future Updates Looking ahead, there are several areas the HCQS committee will be focused on for potential additions/revisions to the HCM, such as: ATDM adjustment values: Many of the adjustment factor values provided for the ATDM methodology are based on minimal research and/or expert opinion. The FHWA is putting considerable resources into quantifying the impacts of various ATDM strategies, and the HCQS committee will update the HCM with these results as they become available. Planning methods: Many of the operational analysis methods in the HCM have become quite complicated and difficult, if not impossible, to solve without software. Many transportation agencies, particularly those that include large rural areas, still desire simple-to-apply analysis methods that will give reasonably accurate results for planning purposes. The HCQS committee is focused on the continued development of planning methods, derived from the full operations methods. Simulation: While the HCM methods are not intended to compete, per se, with simulation methods, the increased complexity of the HCM methods over the last 15 years, combined with the near ubiquity of simulation, has blurred the line on which approach is most applicable for a given analysis situation. Some guidance to help practitioners determine when simulation might be a more appropriate approach than the HCM methods was provided starting with the HCM 2010 edition, but there is still much more room for improvement in this area. This will be a continued area of focus for the HCQS committee. Rural highway analysis (combinations of two-lane segments, multilane highway segments, and occasional intersections). Being addressed in NCHRP Project 08-135 (https://apps.trb.org/cmsfeed/TRBNetProjectDisplay.asp?ProjectID=4747) 3.10 Software Improvements in computing power over time have resulted in increased use of technology to control the road system (e.g., more advanced signal systems), the ability to create more sophisticated models of roadway capacity and quality of service, and the development of software packages to perform HCM analyses. Today, most HCM users apply the HCM methods via software. Even though the majority of HCM users apply HCM methods through software, there is still a need for analysts to understand how a method works, even though they may not be performing step-by-step calculations. They need to know what inputs are required, how variations in those inputs may impact the results, the research foundation for the method, the basic flow of calculations, the range of likely results, and resources to turn to in case of questions. In addition, a subset of users (including analysts who want to explore the reason behind a particular result) still require in-depth information about each method. Originally, HCM methods could be applied with pencil and paper techniques. Today, the HCM is typically applied through software, which provides the capability for: faster analysis and a reduction in computational mistakes larger study areas modeling of more complex phenomena highly iterative calculations It should be noted that there is no official software product for the HCM. This point is made in Chapter 1, Section 3 (p. 1-9) of the HCM, as follows… “To assist users in implementing the methodologies in the manual, commercial software is available (and has been since the publication of the 1985 HCM) to perform the numerical calculations for the more computationally intensive methods.

Freeways are categorized as uninterrupted flow facilities. There are no signalized or stop-controlled at-grade intersections, and direct access to and from adjacent property is not permitted. Access to and from the freeway is limited to ramp locations. Opposing directions of flow are continuously separated by a raised barrier, an at-grade median, or a raised traffic island. Operating conditions on a freeway primarily result from interactions among vehicles and drivers in the traffic stream and between vehicles and their drivers and the geometric characteristics of the freeway. Operations can also be affected by environmental conditions, such as weather or lighting conditions, by pavement conditions, and by the occurrence of traffic incidents. A freeway consists of three component parts: Basic freeway segments: Segments of the freeway that are outside of the influence area of ramps or weaving areas. Weaving areas: Segments of the freeway where two or more vehicle flows must cross each other’s path along a length of the freeway. They are usually formed when an on-ramp is followed by an off-ramp and the two are connected by an auxiliary lane. Merge/Diverge areas: Points at which on- and off-ramps join the freeway. The junction formed at this point is an area of turbulence because of concentrations of merging or diverging vehicles. 4.2 Basic Freeway Segment Figure 4.1: Basic Freeway Segment 4.3 Performance Measures A basic freeway segment is typically characterized by three main performance measures: density in terms of passenger cars per mile per lane, speed in terms of mean passenger car speed, and volume-to-capacity ratio. Each of these measures is an indication of how well or how poorly traffic flow is being accommodated by the freeway segment. 4.4 Service Measure Although speed is a major indicator of service quality to drivers, freedom to maneuver within the traffic stream and proximity to other vehicles are equally noticeable concerns. These other concerns are related to the density of the traffic stream. Furthermore, unlike speed, density increases as flow increases up to capacity, resulting in a measure of effectiveness that is sensitive to a broad range of flows. 4.5 Level of Service For these reasons, density is the performance measure used to define levels of service for basic freeway segments (thus referred to as the service measure). The ranges of density used to define levels of service are as follows: HCM Exhibit 12-15 Level of Service Density (pc/mi/ln) A ≤ 11 B &gt; 11-18 C &gt; 18-26 D &gt; 26-35 E &gt; 35-45 F &gt; 45 or Demand exceeds capacity 4.6 Speed-Flow Relationship (HCM Eq. 12-1) \\[S=\\left\\{\\begin{array}{l} FFS_{adj}&amp;{\\text {if }v_{p} \\leq {BP}}\\\\ FFS_{adj} - \\frac{\\left({FFS}_{adj} - \\frac{c_{adj}}{D_{c}} \\right)\\left(v_{p} - {BP} \\right)^{2.0}}{\\left( c_{adj} - {BP} \\right)^{2.0}}&amp;{\\text {if } BP &lt; v_{p} \\leq c} \\end{array}\\right.\\] c = Capacity in pc/h/ln, vp = 15-min passenger car equivalent flow rate in pc/h/ln, BP = Linear to curvilinear flow rate breakpoint value in pc/h/ln, and Dc = Density at capacity (45 pc/mi/ln). \\[FFS_{adj} = {FFS} \\times{SAF}\\tag{HCM Exhibit 12-6}\\] \\[c = \\text{Min}\\left\\lbrack 2200 + 10\\left({FF}S_{adj} - 50 \\right),2400 \\right\\rbrack {~~~~~ 55 \\leq {FFS} \\leq 75} \\tag{HCM Exhibit 12-6}\\] \\[c_{adj} = {c} \\times{CAF}\\tag {HCM Exhibit 12-6}\\] \\[BP = \\left\\lbrack 1000 + 40\\left( 75 - {FFS}_{adj} \\right) \\right\\rbrack \\times {CAF}^{2} {~~~~~ 55 \\leq {FFS} \\leq 75} \\tag{HCM Exhibit 12-6}\\] Figure 4.2: Basic Freeway Segment Speed-Flow Curves (source: HCM Exhibit 12-16) 4.7 Analysis Procedure Specify Input Data Estimate or Measure Free-Flow Speed Estimate and Adjust Capacity Calculate Analysis Flow Rate Estimate Speed and Density Determine LOS 4.8 Base Conditions Minimum lane widths of 12 ft Minimum right-shoulder lateral clearance between the edge of the travel lane and the nearest obstacle or object influencing traffic behavior of 6 ft (minimum median lateral clearance is 2 ft) Traffic stream consisting of passenger cars only No on- or off-ramps within 3-mi upstream or 3-mi downstream of segment midpoint Level terrain, with grades no greater than 2%; and Driver population dominated by familiar users of the roadway (handled through free-flow speed and capacity adjustment factors) 4.9 Free-Flow Speed Free-flow speed is the mean speed of passenger cars measured under low to moderate flow rates. Two methods can be used to determine the free-flow speed of the basic freeway segment being studied: field measurement or estimation with guidelines provided in the HCM. 4.10 Estimating FFS Estimation of a free-flow speed for an existing or future freeway segment being studied is accomplished by adjusting the base free-flow speed downward to reflect the influence of three factors: lane width, lateral clearance, and ramp density. Estimation of a free-flow speed for an existing or future freeway segment being studied is done according to the following equation: \\[FFS = 75.4 - f_{LW} - f_{RLC} - 3.22\\left({TRD} \\right)^{0.84}\\tag{HCM Eq. 12-2}\\] FFS = free-flow speed (mi/h) 75.4 = base free-flow speed (mi/h) fLW = adjustment for lane width from Table 6.3 (Exhibit 12-20) (mi/h) fRLC = adjustment for right-shoulder lateral clearance from Table 6.4 (Exhibit 12-21) (mi/h) TRD = total ramp density (ramps/mi) 4.10.1 Lane Width Adjustment Factor HCM Exhibit 12-20 Lane width (ft) Reduction in free-flow speed, fLW (mi/h) 12 0.0 11 1.9 10 6.6 4.10.2 Lateral Clearance Adj.

Passenger-car equivalents can be selected for one of two conditions: extended general freeway segments specific grades 4.11.3 Extended General Freeway Segments It is often possible to consider an extended length of freeway containing a number of upgrades, downgrades, and level segments as a single uniform segment. This is possible when no one grade is long enough or steep enough to have a significant effect on the overall operation of the general segment. As a guideline, extended general segment analysis can be used where no one grade of 3 percent or greater is longer than 1/4 mi or where no one grade of less than 3 percent is longer than 1/2 mi. Whenever extended general segment analysis is used, the terrain of the freeway must be classified as level or rolling. Level Terrain. Any combination of grades and horizontal or vertical alignment that permits heavy vehicles to maintain the same speed as passenger cars is classified as level terrain. This classification generally includes short grades of no more than 2 percent. Rolling Terrain. Any combination of grades and horizontal or vertical alignment that causes heavy vehicles to reduce their speeds substantially below those of passenger cars but that does not cause heavy vehicles to operate at crawl speeds for any significant length of time or at frequent intervals is classified as rolling terrain. HCM Exhibit 12-25 Type of Terrain Terrain ET Level 2.0 Rolling 3.0 4.11.4 Specific Grades When the analysis segment consists of terrain that cannot be considered as an extended general segment (i.e., level, rolling), Exhibits 12-26, 12-27, and 12-28 can be used to determine PCE values for specific upgrades and/or downgrades.

A Service flow rate is the maximum hourly rate at which persons or vehicles can reasonably be expected to traverse a point or uniform section of a lane or roadway during a given period under prevailing roadway, traffic, and control conditions while a designated level of service is maintained. The service flow rates are generally based on a 15-min period. Typically, the hourly flow rate is defined as four times the peak 15-min volume. The procedures attempt to establish or predict the maximum rate of flow that can be accommodated by various facilities at each level of service, except LOS F, for which flows are unstable. Thus each facility has five service flow rates, one for each level of service (A through E). Note that service flow rates are discrete values, whereas levels of service represent a range of conditions. Because the service flow rates are defined as maximums for each level of service, they effectively define flow boundaries between the various levels of service. 4.14 Driver Population Adjustment Accounting for the negative influence of non-familiar drivers on traffic flow efficiency is handled through capacity and free-flow speed adjustment factors, per the following table.

Weaving areas are generally formed when a merge area is closely followed by a diverge area, or when an on-ramp is connected to an off-ramp with an auxiliary lane. Figure 5.1: Weaving Flow Paths Three geometric characteristics affect a weaving segment’s operating characteristics: length, width, and configuration. 5.2 Weaving Segment Length Figure 5.2: Weaving Lengths The lengths illustrated are defined as follows: LS = Short length, the distance in feet between the end points of any barrier markings (solid white) that prohibit or discourage lane-changing. The minimum short length value to use in calculations in this methodology is 300 ft. LB = Base length, the distance in feet between points in the respective gore area where the left edge of the ramp traveled way and the right edge of the freeway traveled way meet. Generally, \\[L_{S} = 0.77 \\times L_{B}\\] 5.3 Weaving Segment Width The number of continuous lanes between the entry and exit gore areas. 5.4 Weaving Segment Configuration Configuration refers to the way the entry and exit lanes are linked. It dictates how many lane changes must be made to complete a weaving maneuver. A one-sided weaving segment is one in which no weaving maneuvers require more than two lane changes to be completed successfully, and in which the on-ramp and off-ramp are located on the same side of the freeway. A two-sided weaving segment is one in which at least one weaving maneuver requires three or more lane changes to be completed successfully or in which a single-lane on-ramp is closely followed by a single-lane off-ramp on the opposite side of the freeway.

The subscript i is denoted as follows for the given movements: FF = freeway-to-freeway, FR = freeway-to-ramp, RF = ramp-to-freeway, RR = ramp-to-ramp, W = weaving, and NW = non-weaving. 5.5.3 Step 3 Determine configuration characteristics: LCRF = minimum number of lane changes that must be made by one ramp-to-freeway vehicle to execute the desired maneuver successfully (lc), LCFR = minimum number of lane changes that must be made by one freeway-to-ramp vehicle to execute the desired maneuver successfully (lc). LCRR is used for a two-sided weaving segment, instead of LCRF and LCFR. It is set to the minimum number of lane changes that must be made by a ramp-to-ramp vehicle (lc). In Figure 5.5 this value would be 2. In Figure 5.6 this value would be 3. NWL = number of lanes from which weaving maneuvers may be made with either one or no lane changes (ln).

A ramp roadway may consist of up to three geometric elements of interest: The ramp-freeway junction The ramp roadway The ramp-street junction This presentation focuses on the ramp-freeway junction. On-ramp and off-ramp connections to the freeway create localized sources of increased traffic turbulence (or friction). These points on the freeway need to be analyzed with a separate procedure. 6.2 On- and Off-ramp Influence Areas Merging and diverging activity is most intense in the two freeway lanes closest to the ramp and accel/decel lane and the operational influence area of merge/diverge activity extends for approximately 1500 feet from the ramp-freeway intersection point. Figure 6.1: Merge/Diverge Configurations 6.3 Accel/Decel Lanes A critical geometric parameter influencing operations at a merge or diverge area is the length of the acceleration (LA) or deceleration (LD) lane. The length of such lanes is measured from the point at which the left edge of the ramp lanes and the right edge of the freeway lanes converge to the end of the taper segment connecting the ramp to the freeway. The point of convergence is typically defined by painted markings or physical barriers, or both. Figure 6.2: Accel/Decel Lanes 6.4 Analysis Methodology The basic approach to the analysis of merge and diverge areas focuses on an influence area of 1500 ft, including the acceleration or deceleration lane and Lanes 1 and 2 (the two outside lanes) of the freeway. The analysis methodology has four major steps and one optional step. Specify Inputs and Convert Demand Volumes to Demand Flow Rates Estimate the Approaching Flow Rate in Lanes 1 and 2 of the Freeway Immediately Upstream of the Ramp Influence Area Estimate the Capacity of the Ramp-Freeway Junction and Compare to Demand Flow Rates Estimate Density in the Ramp Influence Area and Determine the Level of Service Estimate Speeds in the Vicinity of Ramp–Freeway Junctions (optional) 6.4.1 Step 1: Volume Conversion Volumes must be converted to equivalent maximum flow rates in passenger cars per hour for the peak 15 minutes of the hour of interest. This can be accomplished by using the following equation. \\[v_{p} = \\frac{V}{PHF \\times f_{HV}}\\tag{HCM Eq. 14-1}\\] vp = 15-min passenger car equivalent flow rate in pc/h/ln, V = hourly volume in veh/h, PHF = peak-hour factor, and fHV = heavy-vehicle adjustment factor. 6.4.2 Step 2: Estimate Flow Entering Lanes 1 and 2 (V12) The flow entering Lanes 1 and 2 (V12) immediately upstream of the merge influence area or the beginning of the deceleration lane at an off-ramp is estimated. This flow is a major determinant of operating characteristics within the ramp influence area. Studies have shown that the principal influences on lane distribution of freeway vehicles immediately upstream of merge or diverge areas are the following: VF , total freeway flow approaching the merge or diverge area (pc/h) VR , total ramp flow (pc/h) LA or LD , total length of the acceleration or deceleration lane (ft) SFR , free-flow speed of ramp at point of merge or diverge (mi/h) Lane distribution at a given ramp may also be influenced by flows on adjacent upstream and downstream ramps. When nearby ramps input vehicles into or remove them from Lane 1, the lane distribution of total vehicles may be significantly altered. Several variables are critical: VU , total flow on an upstream adjacent ramp (pc/h) VD , total flow on a downstream adjacent ramp (pc/h) DU , distance to the adjacent upstream ramp (ft) DD , distance to the adjacent downstream ramp (ft) Whether upstream or downstream adjacent ramps have a significant influence on lane distribution depends on the size of the freeway, the specific combination of upstream or downstream ramp (or both), and the distances and flows involved. 6.4.3 Step 2: Model Structure (On-ramps) The model form for prediction of V12 immediately upstream of single-lane, right-hand on-ramps is: \\[V_{12} = V_{F} \\times P_{FM}\\tag{HCM Eq. 14-2}\\] PFM is the proportion of freeway vehicles remaining in Lanes 1 and 2 immediately upstream of an on-ramp 6.4.4 Step 2: Model Structure (Off-ramps) The model for single-lane, right-hand off-ramps must take a different form. V12 for off-ramps is defined immediately upstream of the beginning of the deceleration lane. Thus, V12 must include VR , the off-ramp flow. The main question is the proportion of through vehicles remaining in Lanes 1 and 2 at this point. A model expressing this logic is: \\[V_{12} = V_{R}+ (V_F-V_R) \\times P_{FD}\\tag{HCM Eq. 14-8}\\] This model focuses on predicting the choice to be made by approaching freeway drivers not exiting at the ramp (i.e., drivers with a choice to make). 6.4.5 Step 2: PFM Equations for On-ramps HCM Exhibit 14-8 No. of Freeway Lanesa Model(s) for Determining PFM 4 PFM = 1.000 6 PFM = 0.5775 + 0.000028LA PFM = 0.7289 - 0.0000135(vF + vR) - 0.003296SFR + 0.000063LUP PFM = 0.5487 + 0.2628(vD/LDOWN) For vF/SFR ≤ 72: PFM = 0.2178 - 0.000125vR + 0.01115(LA/SFR) 8 For vF/SFR &gt; 72: PFM = 0.2178 - 0.000125vR Selecting equations for PFM for six-lane freeways Adjacent Upstream Ramp Subject Ramp Adjacent Downstream Ramp Equation(s) Used None On None Equation 14-3 None On On Equation 14-3 None On Off Equation 14-5 or 14-3 On On None Equation 14-3 Off On None Equation 14-4 or 14-3 On On On Equation 14-3 On On Off Equation 14-5 or 14-3 Off On On Equation 14-4 or 14-3 Off On Off Equation 14-5 or 14-4 or 14-3 Notes: a 4 lanes = two lanes in each direction; 6 lanes = three lanes in each direction; 8 lanes = four lanes in each direction.

If an adjacent ramp on a six-lane freeway is not a one-lane, right-side off-ramp, use Equation 14-9. Check Reasonableness of Lane Distribution Estimation 1. The average flow per lane in the outer lanes of the freeway (lanes other than 1 and 2) should not be higher than 2,700 pc/h/ln. 2. The average flow per lane in outer lanes should not be higher than 1.5 times the average flow in Lanes 1 and 2.

The adjusted value replaces the original value of V12 and the analysis continues. Eight-Lane Freeway (4 lanes per direction) If vav34 is greater than 2,700 pc/h/ln, use Eq. 14-18: \\[v_{av34} = {v_{F}-5400}\\tag{HCM Eq. 14-18}\\] If vav34 is greater than 1.5 × (v12/2), use Eq. 14-19: \\[v_{12a} = \\frac{v_{F}}{2.5}\\tag{HCM Eq. 14-19}\\] where v12a equals the adjusted flow rate in Lanes 1 and 2 immediately upstream of the ramp influence area (pc/h) If both limitations on outer lane flow rate are violated, the result yielding the highest value of v12a is used. The adjusted value replaces the original value of v12 and the analysis continues. 6.4.7 Step 3: Estimate Capacity of Ramp-Freeway Junction Determine critical capacity values and compare to demand flows. The comparison determines whether the merge or diverge area is likely to break down. Capacity is evaluated at two points: the maximum total flow departing from the merge or diverge area (VFO) and the maximum total flow that can reasonably enter the merge or diverge influence area (VR12 for on-ramps; V12 for off-ramps). If demand exceeds either of these two capacity values, breakdown may occur. Figure 6.3: Merge Volume Figure 6.4: Diverge Volume Capacity Values: Merge and Diverge Areas The capacity of merge areas is controlled by either of the following two criteria: the total flow leaving the merge area on the downstream freeway (VFO) or the maximum flow entering the merge influence area (VR12). The total flow leaving the merge area is subject to the constraints of the downstream freeway section. There is no evidence that the turbulence of the merge area causes the downstream freeway capacity to be less than that of a basic freeway segment. Thus, for stable flow operations to exist, the sum of the merging flows cannot exceed the capacity of the downstream freeway segment. It is possible, however, to experience congestion in the merge influence area even if the capacity of the downstream freeway segment is adequate. Studies have shown that there is a practical maximum flow that may enter the merge influence area and still maintain stable operations. In a ramp merge junction, both the flow in Lanes 1 and 2 and the flow in the on-ramp enter the merge influence area. Thus, \\[V_{R12} = V_{R}+ V_{12}\\tag{HCM Eq. 14-20}\\] The capacity values for merge areas are shown in the table (HCM Exhibit 14-10) at the end of this section: If the VR12 maximum flow is exceeded, LOS F conditions will not necessarily exist, as traffic flow will redistribute to utilize excess capacity in outer lanes. If the freeway capacity is exceeded, queuing conditions are expected to exist, and LOS is F. If LOS F exists, the analysis ends. The freeway facilities procedure can be applied in this case. Where stable operations are expected, the next step of the analysis—estimation of density in the merge influence area—is implemented to find the level of service. Three capacity values need to be checked in a diverge area: the capacity of the upstream freeway lanes approaching the diverge area, the capacity of the downstream freeway lanes departing the diverge area, and the capacity of the off-ramp. The total flow that can leave the diverge area is generally limited by the capacity of the freeway lanes approaching the diverge junction. In all appropriate diverge designs, the number of lanes leaving the diverge area is either equal to or one greater than the number entering. This departing flow is designated VFO. The flow entering Lanes 1 and 2 just upstream of the deceleration lane is simply the flow in Lanes 1 and 2 (V12). This flow includes the off-ramp flow. The table below (HCM Exhibit 14-10) provides capacity values for the first two capacity checks.

The third limit is most important because it is the primary reason for failure of diverge areas. Failure at a diverge is most often related to the capacity of one of the exit legs, usually the ramp. The capacity of each exit leg must be checked against the expected demand.

It can analyze multiple contiguous segments over multiple time intervals.

Figure 7.4: Ramp Segmentation 1 If there is more than 3000 ft between ramps, place a basic segment in between. The length of the basic segment will be the total separation distance between the ramps minus 3000 ft. Figure 7.5: Ramp Segmentation 2 If there is less than 3000 ft between ramps, place an ‘overlap’ segment in between The length of the overlap segment will be 3000 ft minus the total separation distance between the ramps. Figure 7.6: Ramp Segmentation 3 If a lane is added at an on-ramp junction (i.e., the “acceleration lane” is a full lane), the ramp segment is analyzed as a basic segment. If a lane is dropped at an off-ramp junction (i.e., the outer lane turns into the off-ramp lane), the ramp segment is analyzed as a basic segment. Weaving Segments If the short length is greater than Lmax, the weaving segment is analyzed as a basic segment. 7.1.6 Demand Flow Rates Determine demands by time period (default is 15 min) Ensure that the sum of inputs equals the sum of outputs Adjust flow rates for heavy vehicles The PHF is not used since the time period duration is 15 minutes 7.1.7 Segment Capacity Estimation and Adjustment Determine segment capacities according to the methods of Chapters 12, 13, and 14. Segment adjustments Construction activities or work zones Adverse weather (rain, snow, fog) Incidents or accidents Ramp metering can be accommodated by modifying on-ramp roadway capacities. 7.1.8 Compute d/c Ratios Calculate demand/capacity ratio for each segment for each time period If all segment d/c ratios are ≤ 1.0 for a time period, then segment performance measures are calculated according to Chapters 12, 13, and/or 14. If any segment d/c ratio &gt; 1.0 in a given time period, then the oversaturated analysis module is applied for all facility segments during that time period and subsequent time periods until the congestion clears. 7.1.9 Downstream Speed Constraint In case of a slow average speed for a segment upstream of the subject segment, the subject segment speed will be constrained, per Eq. 25-1. \\[V_{max} = FFS - \\left( FFS - v_{prev} \\right) \\times e^{-0.00162 \\times L}\\] where: Vmax = maximum achievable segment speed (mi/h), FFS = segment free-flow speed (mi/h), Vprev = average speed on immediate upstream segment (mi/h), and L = distance from midpoints of the upstream segment and the subject segment (ft). 7.1.10 Density Segment densities are calculated per the methods of chapters 12, 13, and 14. However, merge/diverge segments use density for entire cross-section.

A dynamic illustration of the following figure will be demonstrated in class. Figure 7.7: Time-Space Matrix 7.2.6 Key Analysis Concepts Shock Waves Shock waves occur at points where there is a change in traffic stream characteristics (e.g., densities). For example, Faster vehicles catching up to slower vehicles in a school or work zone Free-flowing vehicles approaching the back of queued vehicles at a bottleneck Queued vehicles discharging from a signalized intersection approach A “wave” of changing density will propagate upstream or downstream, depending on specific characteristics of colliding traffic streams. Demand volume (in units of lanes) for 4 time periods is: 1) 1.5 (&lt; 2 lanes of bottleneck segment, so no queuing) 2) 2.5 (&gt; 2 lanes of bottleneck segment, so backward formingshock wave) 3) 2.0 (= lanes of bottleneck segment, so rear stationary shock wave) 4) 1.5 (&lt; 2 lanes of bottleneck segment, so forward recovery shock wave) Figure 7.8: Shockwave Diagram Analysis Time Units Minutes per Time Period (min/period) = 15 Time Steps (ts) per Minute (ts/min) = 4 Seconds per Time Step (s/ts) = 60 (s/min) / 4 (ts/min) = 15 Time Steps per Hour (ts/h) = 4 ts/min \\(\\times\\) 60 min/h = 240 Flow-Density Relationship Traffic operations in the congested flow regime are not well understood Given the lack of consensus on appropriate models for describing speed-flow-density relationships for congested flow, the HCM freeway facilities procedure uses a simplified linear relationship to describe congested operations: \\[k_{queue}=k_{cap}+\\frac{(k_{jam}-k_{cap})}{q_{cap}} \\times (q_{cap}-q)\\] where: \\(k_{queue}\\) = density in the queue (veh/mi) \\(k_{cap}\\) = density at capacity (veh/mi) \\(k_{jam}\\) = jam density (veh/mi) q = segment flow rate (veh/h) \\(q_{cap}\\) = segment capacity flow rate (veh/h) The speed of the traffic stream in the queue is given by: \\[S_{B}=\\frac{S_{O}C_{B}}{C_{B}+S_{O}K_{j}\\times \\bigg (1-\\frac{C_{B}}{C_{N}}\\bigg)}\\] where: \\(S_{B}\\) = speed of traffic in bottleneck queue (mi/h) \\(S_{O}\\) = speed of traffic at capacity flow rate (mi/h); sometimes referred to as ‘optimal speed’ \\(C_{B}\\) = bottlenenck capacity (veh/h) \\(C_{N}\\) = pre-breakdown capacity flow rate (veh/h); sometimes referred to as ‘normal capacity’ \\(k_{j}\\) = jam density (veh/mi) Figure 7.9: Flow Density Relationship Background Density (KB) Background density (veh/mi) over Time Period (p) is the density of the subject segment assuming there is no queuing on the segment. This density is calculated using the expected demand on the segment in the corresponding undersaturated procedure in Chapters 12–14. \\[KB = \\frac{v}{S}\\] where: v = flow rate (veh/h) S = average speed (mi/h) Queue Density (KQ) Queue density on the subject segment during the given time step is calculated on the basis of a linear density‐flow relationship in the congested regime (see Fig. 7.9). Note that the following equation is equivalent to the \\(k_{queue}\\) equation given above. \\[KQ=KJ-\\frac{(KJ-KC) \\times SF}{SC}\\tag{HCM Eq. 25-10}\\] where: KJ = jam density (veh/mi) KC = density at capacity (veh/mi) SF = segment flow rate (veh/h) SC = segment capacity flow rate (veh/h) On-Ramp Considerations For an on-ramp, the demand served is a function of the ramp demand and the available capacity on the mainline. If the available capacity, which is the difference between the capacity of the mainline and the upstream mainline demand, is less than one half of a mainline lane of capacity (in the example shown below, this is 5 veh/time step), then you can serve a maximum of one-half of the lane capacity from the on-ramp (5 veh/ts in the example below). Of course, if the ramp demand is less than this value, then just this lower ramp demand value is served. However, the ramp demand also needs to consider unserved (i.e., queued) vehicles from previous time steps. Figure 7.10: On-Ramp Considerations for Oversaturated Analysis Off-Ramp Considerations For an off-ramp, we must consider potential demand deficit, which is the amount of unserved traffic from the previous time period. This typically occurs due to a bottleneck immediately upstream of the off-ramp (such as illustrated in the figure below). When the deficit is greater than the mainline/segment flow, we apply the off-ramp proportion from the previous time period. This is because the deficit traffic is the unserved traffic from the previous time period. The deficit is reduced by the amount of mainline flow per time step. If the deficit is less than the mainline/segment flow, but greater than zero, then the off-ramp proportion from the previous time period is applied to the deficit amount (again, because this is the left over traffic from the previous time period) and the current time period off-ramp proportion is applied to the difference between the mainline/segment flow and the deficit. When the deficit is zero, only the off-ramp proportion for the current time period is applied. Figure 7.11: Off-Ramp Considerations for Oversaturated Analysis 7.2.7 Methodology Flow Chart The overall flow of the oversaturation analysis procedure is illustrated in the following flow chart. Figure 7.12: Oversaturated Analysis Flow Chart 7.3 Travel Time Reliability 7.3.1 Overview Paraphrased from the HCM 6th Edition… Freeway travel time reliability (TTR) reflects the distribution of the travel times for trips traversing an entire freeway facility over an extended period of time, typically one year, during any portion of the day. A one-year Reliability Reporting Period (RRP) is typical, as it covers most variation in travel times arising from various factors. Shorter RRPs are possible for special circumstances, such as a focus on summer tourist travel or the work zone construction season. Rather than evaluating only an ”average” or ”typical” day with good weather and no incidents, a reliability analysis looks at the effects of various conditions/situations that temporarily reduce a freeway’s performance over the course of a year or other long-term time frame, such as… Fluctuating demand Non-ideal weather Incidents Work zones Each combination of demand level, weather condition, incident type, etc. during a given day is termed a ”scenario”. A set of scenarios is generated (in a software tool) based on the probability of a particular condition occurring; one scenario is generated for each day within the RRP (for example, each non-holiday weekday throughout the year). The facility travel time is evaluated for each 15-minute time period within the study period for each scenario, by repeatedly applying the Chapter 10 analysis method, resulting in a distribution of travel times that can be used to generate a variety of useful reliability-related performance measures (such as illustrated in the following figure). Figure 7.13: Example Travel Time Distribution (Source: Highway Capacity Manual, Chapter 11, 6th Ed.) The typical analysis units for a TTR analysis are illustrated in the following figure. Figure 7.14: Example TTR Analysis Units (Source: Highway Capacity Manual, Chapter 11, 6th Ed.) A variety of travel time indices are typically used to characterize the results of a TTR analysis. Travel time index (TTI) is defined as the ratio of the actual travel time to the free-flow travel time. By definition, TTI is always ≥ 1.0. Percentile travel time index (TTIpp). Represents the percentile TTI in the travel time distribution. For example… TTI85 means that this observation is exceeded only 15% of the time in the travel time distribution. TTI50 is the median TTI. TTI95 is the 95th percentile TTI, and is commonly referred to as the planning time index (PTI). Essentially, this is the additional time you should plan for your trip to ensure that you arrive on time all but about once per month (1 out of 20 weekdays). 7.4 References Transportation Research Board (2022).

Additionally, other vehicles may be considered as well, regardless of occupancy, for example: Transit (dead-heading, meaning empty bus being driven to bus depot) Commercial (usually not) Emergency (when responding to an emergency) Motorcycles Hybrid/electric vehicles (to encourage people to purchase more environmentally-friendly vehicles) 8.2.4.3 Hours of Operation Typical Options 24-hr Minimizes motorist confusion—easier to enforce Provides benefits to carpoolers at all times (an incident/congestion may occur at any time) Signage is simpler to implement Usually only option with barrier-separated facilities or special access facilities (e.g., median ramps) During periods of minimal use, can lead to negative public perception Peak periods only Typically 6:00-9:00 AM and 4:00-7:00 PM May also be directional (e.g., HOV lane in peak direction and GP lane in off-peak direction, and switch between AM and PM periods) Gives carpoolers advantage when GP lanes are most likely to be congested May result in a more positive perception by public due to better utilization around the clock Enforcement may be more difficult due to more motorist confusion about eligible time periods 8.2.4.4 Enforcement Is critical to viability and integrity of HOV program Need to consider enforcement areas in roadway design Consider other non-traditional options, such as violation-reporting hotline Have appropriate fines Need to also include education If interested, see following paper for more information: Newman, Bruce R., Washburn, Scott S. and Nihan, Nancy L.

A traffic lane, or lanes, that is available to high occupancy vehicles and other exempt vehicles without charge In some places, such as Miami, the HOV vehicles need to be registered.

Signals placed at end of on-ramps to regulate the flow of on-ramp traffic onto the freeway. Vehicles queued at the signal are served one at a time (i.e., one vehicle per green indication) Typically operate during peak traffic flow periods Typically operated by state agency (e.g., FDOT) Figure 9.1: Ramp Meter (Signal): I-5, Seattle just north of downtown Figure 9.2: Ramp Meter Figure 9.3: Ramp Meter 9.2 Why Meter Ramps? To reduce or prevent mainline congestion Keep freeway running at or near capacity for longer periods of time Discourage short freeway trips Improve safety on mainline by reducing frequency of stop-and-go traffic conditions Improve merge safety Break up merging platoons Decrease side-swipe and rear-end accidents 9.2.1 Conceptual Background of Ramp Metering Congestion is simply a byproduct of demand exceeding capacity Thus, to prevent congestion, demand must be controlled A direct method of controlling demand is by regulating the amount of traffic allowed to enter the mainline from the on-ramps 9.2.2 System Benefits of Ramp Metering Higher Freeway Speeds Less Delay to Freeway Users Higher Freeway Service Volumes Reduced Travel Time to Freeway Users Safer Merging Operations Reduced Operating Costs to Freeway Users Reduced Fuel Consumption and Emissions 9.3 Consequences of Ramp Metering Queuing at ramps Driver diversion to other routes Driver diversion to other modes Driver diversion to other times of day 9.4 Ramp Metering Hardware/Infrustructure Typical Detector Configuration Figure 9.4: Typical Detector Configuration Typical Ramp Hardware Figure 9.5: Typical Ramp Hardware Typical Signal Display Figure 9.6: Typical Ramp Metering Signal Figure 9.7: Advance Warning Display Figure 9.8: Miami: I-95/NW 6th Ave Figure 9.9: Miami: I-95/NW 81st St Figure 9.10: Miami: I-95/NW 81st St Figure 9.11: Multilane Metering (California) Figure 9.12: Multilane Metering (California) 9.5 Example Ramp Meter Control Strategies 9.5.1 Ramp Closure Manually placed barriers Automated barriers Signing Figure 9.13: I-25, between Cheyenne and Denver Advantages Inexpensive and Easy Disadvantages Could result in unused mainline capacity May cause undesirable diversion Will not win any popularity contests 9.5.2 Pre-Timed Metering rate not directly influenced by mainline traffic conditions Determination of metering rates from historical traffic counts Often consists of different programs for different times of day Advantages Relatively easy to implement No detection necessary Disadvantages Cannot efficiently address day-to-day variations Cannot account for non-recurring congestion 9.5.3 Traffic Responsive Metering rate is a function of mainline traffic conditions Metering rate updated every 30-60 seconds Advantages Better utilizes available mainline capacity Usually lower ramp delay Disadvantages Needs mainline detectors 9.5.4 Gap Acceptance Sensors upstream in outside lane detect gap sizes When adequate size gap is detected, ramp vehicle is released to merge into this gap Used in conjunction with speed detector If traffic is congested, use minimum metering rate Advantages Safe merge condition likely Possible lower travel time from meter to merge point (less speed adjustment by merge vehicle) Disadvantages More irregular metering operation pattern Longer queue delays Does not utilize freeway capacity as effectively 9.5.5 Integrated Ramp Control Adjacent on-ramp meters are interconnected. Individual ramp meter rates are interdependent on other ramps and freeway operations within system. Strategies can be applied either locally or system-wide. 9.6 Practical Considerations Ramp Queuing Storage HOV Bypass Lanes Minimum/Maximum Metering Rates Violation Enforcement Equity Issues Detection Capabilities System Capabilities 9.6.1 Ramp Queuing Storage Have to account for possibility of ramp overflowing to upstream intersections if storage is inadequate. Some agencies respond by discharging ramp (i.e., usually set to maximum metering rate) This counteracts metering strategy 9.6.2 HOV Bypass Lanes HOV bypass lanes allow carpool vehicles enter freeway without stopping for ramp meter. A separate lane is provided so that ramp queue can be completely bypassed. This will potentially encourage carpooling, with or without mainline HOV lanes. This complicates metering scheme because this uncontrolled volume has to be taken into account. If you cannot enforce, usually will create more problems than it solves. Figure 9.14: Ramp Meter with HOV bypass Figure 9.15: Ramp Meter with HOV bypass 9.6.3 Min/Max Metering Rates Maximum Typically around 900 veh/h (15 veh/min) This corresponds to a maximum practical discharge rate of 1 vehicle every 4 seconds Minimum Typically between 180 to 240 veh/h (3 to 4 veh/min) Anything less than this and many motorists will think the signal is broken and then violate 9.6.4 Violation Enforcement There WILL be violators. Extent of violation will be directly linked to motorists’ perception of level of enforcement This will be compounded if HOV bypass lane has high violation rate Violations still have to be factored into metering scheme/algorithm. Be prepared for major public perception problems if enforcement is inadequate. Also, violations will beget more violations Figure 9.16: HOV Bypass, 47.6439888, -122.3045164 Figure 9.17: HOV Bypass 9.6.5 Equity Issues Very undesirable to have large disparity between metering rates of adjacent on-ramp meters Motorists will figure it out and complicate your metering scheme/algorithm 9.6.6 Detection Capabilities Detection capabilities will greatly influence robustness and responsiveness of system. Need to consider both mainline and ramp detection 9.6.7 System Capabilities Detection capability is major component of system capability. Need to consider reactive system versus proactive system and impact on capacity utilization. 9.7 Utah DOT video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-QFG1pIaO8 "],["10-Simulation.html", "Chapter 10 Introduction to Traffic Simulation 10.1 What is Simulation? 10.2 Terminology 10.3 Why use simulation? 10.4 Simulation Modeling Approaches 10.5 Considerations for applying Simulation 10.6 Conceptual Differences between the HCM and Microscopic Simulation Modeling", " Chapter 10 Introduction to Traffic Simulation 10.1 What is Simulation? Dictionary definition: The representation of the behavior or characteristics of one system through the use of another system, esp. a computer program designed for the purpose. A definition more specific to our purposes: A numerical technique for conducting experiments on a computer, which may include stochastic characteristics, be microscopic or macroscopic in nature, and involve mathematical models that describe the behavior of a system over extended periods of real time. Simulation tools, or programs, utilize a collection of mathematical models and algorithms in representing the transportation system. 10.2 Terminology The term ‘model’ gets applied almost universally to any concept involving simulation (i.e., ‘simulation model’), but it is important to understand that there are several different contexts in which this may apply. First, more generally, a model could be one of the following (not an exhaustive list): Physical Analytical Simulation Physical models are usually applied in situations where the real system can be significantly reduced in scale. Thus, they have very limited application in transportation engineering, primarily because of the difficulty of downsizing humans. Analytical models may be a single equation that relates one or more independent variables to a dependent variable. Many of the HCM equations fall into this category, for example: Total lane-changing rate for weaving vehicles: \\[{LC}_{W}={LC}_{MIN} + 0.39\\lbrack\\left(L_{S} - 300 \\right)^{0.5} \\times N^2 \\times {(1 + ID)}^{0.8}\\rbrack\\] Proportion of vehicles remaining in lanes 1 and 2 of on-ramp merge area: \\[{P}_{FM} = 0.2178 - 0.000125{v}_{R} + 0.01115 \\bigg(\\frac{{L}_{A}}{{S}_{FR}}\\bigg)\\] It can be defined more broadly as well, as is done in the HCM, as follows: A procedure that uses one or more algorithms to produce a set of numerical outputs describing the operation of a highway segment or system, given a set of numerical inputs. Another useful term is ‘algorithm’. Dictionary definitions of algorithm include: a procedure for solving a mathematical problem in a finite number of steps that frequently involves repetition of an operation a step-by-step procedure for solving a problem or accomplishing some end The HCM defines algorithm as: A set of rules for solving a problem in a finite number of steps. An algorithm often includes one or more analytical models. Simulation, again, generally refers to a computerized representation of a real-life system. Within a traffic simulation, multiple algorithms are usually employed to model the various features of the transportation system (roadway, vehicles, control devices, etc.). Thus, when the term ‘simulation model’ is used, it should be understood to mean the application of simulation to model the various aspects of a transportation system. ‘Simulation model’ should not be used as a synonym for a traffic simulation software program or tool. Specific traffic simulation software programs (e.g., SwashSim, CORSIM, VISSIM, Aimsun, TransModeler, etc.) are just that, ‘software programs’ or ‘software tools’, not ‘models’. Said another way, a simulation software tool (e.g., VISSIM) utilizes a collection of analytical models and algorithms to provide one with the ability to create a virtual model of a transportation system. 10.3 Why use simulation? Scenario is too complicated to solve by analytical methods Scenario is too expensive to test in the field Scenario is too dangerous to test in the field Can easily test varying traffic scenarios Can test identical traffic scenarios on various model alternatives Can experiment with new situations that do not currently exist System can be studied in real time or compressed time 10.4 Simulation Modeling Approaches 10.4.1 Spatial and Temporal Level of Detail Microscopic: Individual vehicle/person movements are modeled and tracked Macroscopic: Performance measures are based on aggregate relationships (e.g., flow-speed-density) Mesoscopic: Individual vehicles are tracked, but simpler models for car-following, lane-changing, etc. are used. Also may be event-based rather than time-step based, or time-step resolution may be decreased. Hybrid: combination of different approaches 10.4.2 Stochastic Input values and model parameters are varied randomly Most applicable to microscopic simulations Based on probabilistic distributions e.g., Poisson (or Neg. Exp.) for vehicle arrivals For specific inputs (using distribution parameters, such as mean and std. dev.), outputs will vary 10.4.3 Deterministic Input values and model parameters are explicitly known for explicit times e.g., vehicle headways are generated according to a uniform distribution For specific inputs, outputs will always be the same 10.4.4 Potential Analytical Models within Simulation Program Vehicle Arrivals time headways–microscopic flow rate–macroscopic Car-following theory (microscopic) Shock wave theory (macroscopic) Lane changing (microscopic or macroscopic) Merging/gap acceptance (microscopic) Queuing theory (microscopic or macroscopic) 10.5 Considerations for applying Simulation Simulation is one tool among many available to the analyst Simulation is not a one-size-fits-all solution Simulation is time consuming and expensive. Do not underestimate time and cost. Simulation models (i.e., models of the transportation system) require considerable input data, some of which may be difficult or impossible to obtain. Simulation models require verification, calibration, and validation, which, if overlooked, makes the model useless. Whatever simulation tool you apply, you must understand how the underlying models/algorithms work, especially their limitations and assumptions. Some users apply simulation tools and treat them as black boxes and really do not understand the process of translating inputs to outputs, and consequently are not able to critically review the outputs for reasonableness. Thus, simulation should not be applied unless… Careful evaluation has been made of the suitability of simulation to solve the problem, effectively and efficiently The user fully understands all the fundamental underpinnings of the tool 10.6 Conceptual Differences between the HCM and Microscopic Simulation Modeling 10.6.1 Introduction To better determine when simulation of a roadway facility may be more appropriate than an HCM analysis, the fundamental differences between the two analysis approaches must be understood. HCM Analysis Approach HCM methods are generally analytical and deterministic Oversaturated freeway facility analysis is essentially a macroscopic simulation Travel Time Reliability analysis includes some stochastic elements (weather, incident events) The HCM methodologies consist of series of equations—each one intended to described some element of the traffic stream characteristics, at a macroscopic level—that culminate in the estimation of one or more performance measures. 10.6.2 Capacity (HCM) Capacity values provided in the HCM are generally determined from empirical data (i.e., field data collected around the country). The provided capacity estimates are a function of the specified free-flow speed, as adjusted by lane width, shoulder width, and ramp density (i.e., HCM Eq. 12-2). \\[FFS=75.4-f_{LW}-{RLC}-3.22({TRD})^{0.84}\\] Figure 10.1: HCM Exhibit 12-16 FFS (mi/h) Capacity (pc/h/ln) 75 2400 70 2400 65 2350 60 2400 55 2300 75 2250 10.6.3 Capacity (Simulation) For microscopic simulation programs, capacity is typically a function of the specified minimum vehicle entry headway (into the system) and car-following parameters. For example, specifying a value of 1.5 seconds for this input will result in a maximum vehicle entry rate of 2400 (3600/1.5) vehicles per hour per lane. Once vehicles enter the system, vehicle headways are governed by the car following model, except for lead vehicles. An issue to be aware of is that while geometric factors such as lane and shoulder width affect the free-flow speed (which in turn affects capacity) in the HCM procedure, some simulation programs do not account for these effects, or they may account for other factors, such as horizontal curvature, that the HCM procedure does not consider. 10.6.4 Lane Distribution (HCM) For basic freeway segments, there is an implicit assumption that for any given vehicle demand, the vehicles are evenly distributed across all lanes. For ramp junctions, the HCM procedure includes calculations to determine how vehicles are distributed across lanes as a result of merging or diverging movements. For weaving segments, there is not an explicit determination of flow rates in specific lanes, but consideration of weaving and non-weaving flows and the number of lanes available for each is an essential element of the analysis procedure. 10.6.5 Lane Distribution (Simulation) The distribution of vehicles across lanes is typically specified just for the entry points of the network. Once vehicles have entered the network, the vehicles will be distributed across lanes according to car-following and lane-changing logic. This input value should reflect field data if it is available. If field data indicate an imbalance of flows across lanes, this situation may lead to a difference in results between the HCM and the simulation tool. If field data are not available, specifying an even distribution of traffic across all lanes is probably reasonable for networks that begin with a long length of a basic segment. If there is a ramp junction within a short distance downstream of the entry point of the network, setting the lane distribution values to be consistent with those from the HCM ramp segment analysis will likely yield more consistent results. 10.6.6 Traffic Stream Composition (HCM) Vehicles The HCM deals, mostly, with the presence of non-passenger car vehicles in the traffic stream by applying passenger car equivalent (PCE) values. These values are based on the percentage of small trucks and large trucks in the traffic stream, as well as type of terrain (grade profile and its length). Thus, the traffic stream is converted into some equivalent number of only passenger cars, and the analysis results are based on flow rates in these units. Figure 10.2: Simulation usually explicitly models heavy vehicles Figure 10.3: Example of impact of trucks on speed for varying upgrades Drivers The HCM procedures do not explicitly account for differences in driver types. However, the empirical data that the HCM procedures are based on include the effects of the various driver types present in the traffic streams during data collection. 10.6.7 Traffic Stream Composition (Simulation) Vehicles Simulation programs deal with the traffic stream composition just as it specified; that is, the specific percentages of each vehicle type are generated into the system and moved through the system according to their specific vehicle attributes (acceleration, deceleration capabilities, etc.). Thus, simulation results likely better reflect the effects of non-passenger car vehicles on the traffic stream. Although in some instances the PCE values contained in the HCM were developed from simulation data, simplifying assumptions made to make them implementable in an analytical procedure result in some loss of fidelity of the treatment of different vehicle types. In the case of stochastic-based simulators, the generated vehicle type percentages may only approximate the specified percentages. Drivers Most microscopic simulation programs explicitly provide for a range of driver types and allow a number of factors related to driver type to be modified (e.g., desired speed, gap acceptance threshold, etc.). 10.6.8 Comparison of HCM Results to Simulation Results 10.6.8.1 Density HCM The HCM procedures report density in terms of passenger cars per mile. Passenger car equivalency (PCE) factors are used to convert heavy vehicles to passenger cars. PCEs are applied prior to the density computations. Simulation Simulation tools report density in terms of actual vehicles per mile. The effect of heavy vehicles is an explicit result of their different characteristics. Because of this difference, it is difficult to apply PCE factors in reverse to simulation results for purposes of comparison to HCM results. 10.6.8.2 Flow Rate The HCM procedures deal with peak 15‐min period demand flow rates, by applying a peak hour factor (PHF) to hourly volumes. Simulation tools do not normally apply a PHF to input volumes. Some care must therefore be used to ensure that the demand and time periods are represented appropriately to promote the development of comparable results. 10.6.8.3 Ramp Junctions The individual segment analysis of ramp merge/diverge segments focus on the density of traffic within the influence of the merge area (usually the ramp and the two adjacent lanes). The segment length is also assumed to be 1500 ft. To obtain comparable results from simulation, it is necessary to define the merge area as a separate segment for analysis and to isolate the movements in the adjacent lanes. HCM method does not strictly adhere to q = uk relationship The HCM procedures typically do not consider the effect of self‐aggravating phenomena on the performance of a segment. For example, when traffic in a left turn bay spills over into the adjacent through lane the effect of the through lane performance is not considered. The inability of drivers to access their desired lane when queues back up from a downstream facility is not taken into consideration. Full numerical compatibility between HCM and simulation‐based analyses will seldom be attainable because of the differences in definitions, modeling approaches, and computational methodologies. For example, differences in the implicit or explicit representation of the network structure may lead to unavoidable differences in a performance measure result, even if all other differences were able to be controlled for between HCM and simulation. One such performance measure is control delay, which by the HCM definition includes delay due to deceleration, stop, and acceleration—these components usually span more than one link in a simulation network, yet the simulation calculation procedures usually do not consider the acceleration delay downstream of the signal stop bar.
